Memory Synchronization Tests for Buffer: write after write.

- Create one single buffer and initialize it to 0. Wait on the fence to ensure the data is initialized.
Write a number (say 1) into the buffer via render pass, compute pass, copy or writeBuffer.
Write another number (say 2) into the same buffer via render pass, compute pass, copy, or writeBuffer.
Wait on another fence, then call expectContents to verify the written buffer.
  - x= 1st write type: {storage buffer in {compute, render, render-via-bundle}, t2b-copy, b2b-copy, writeBuffer}
  - x= 2nd write type: {storage buffer in {compute, render, render-via-bundle}, t2b-copy, b2b-copy, writeBuffer}
  - if pass type is the same, x= {single pass, separate passes} (note: render has loose guarantees)
  - if not single pass, x= writes in {same cmdbuf, separate cmdbufs, separate submits, separate queues}
