 * Provenance for tests found by mutation testing.
 *
 * Each test was found by deliberately injecting a small change (a "mutant") into one component's
 * source, here the Mesa NIR compiler, and searching for a shader whose result differs between the
 * mutated and unmutated builds. The rest of the CTS did not detect these mutants, which means that
 * the tests check behaviour that existing tests did not.
