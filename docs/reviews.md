- The test plan covers the area described by the file/test name and file/test description
  as fully as possible (or adds TODOs for incomplete areas).
- Validation tests have control cases (where no validation error should occur).
- Each validation rule is tested in isolation, in at least one case which does not validate any
  other validation rules.
